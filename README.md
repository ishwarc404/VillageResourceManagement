One of the main problems faced by villagers is the lack of knowledge about the availability of resources such as water, electricity, and ration. The entire delivery system right now is riddled with corruption and many more problems that devoid the villagers of these resources. Hence with the help of a partner, we are designing a de-centralized full-stack system that will allow the authorities to update the status of any resources or help communicate any information with the villagers; and would also allow the citizens to track the resources.
The application can be accessed in 3 different formats.
1. Via a web-portal
2. Via a very light and simple Android/iOS application.
3. Via an SMS based system which we have achieved by setting up local SMS servers, which then access the database with the numbers of all the citizens and broadcast resource update messages to them on a click of a button. The citizens can too register complaints or query more via SMS.
